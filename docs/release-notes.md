## 🔮 Planned Features

### Future Development
*Note: The following features are planned for future versions but are not currently implemented*

#### Version 2.0.0 (Future Major Release)
- **Command-line interface**: Full CLI for automation and scripting
- **Plugin system**: Third-party extension support
- **Additional input formats**: More texture atlas formats beyond PNG/XML/TXT
- **Enhanced memory management**: Dynamic memory limit controls
- **Performance improvements**: GPU acceleration and advanced optimization

#### Near-term Improvements
- **Drag & drop support**: Easier file loading through drag and drop
- **Undo/redo system**: Reversible operations for settings changes
- **Preset management**: Save and load configuration presets
- **Advanced filtering**: Search and filter animations
- **Extended image format support**: Support for additional input image formats

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Current Limitations
- **Large file handling**: Very large atlases (>4GB) may cause memory issues on systems with limited RAM
- **Complex XML variants**: Some non-standard XML formats may not be fully supported
- **Platform differences**: Minor UI differences between operating systems
- **Preview performance**: Large animations may preview slowly on older hardware
- **Memory limit controls**: Memory limit settings in preferences are not yet active (UI placeholder for future implementation)

### Workarounds
- **Memory issues**: Process animations individually for very large atlases
- **XML compatibility**: Convert to standard Starling/Sparrow format if needed
- **Performance**: Use lower scale settings for previews, full scale for final export
- **Complex animations**: Break down large animation sets into smaller batches
