# TextureAtlas to GIF and Frames

This tool simplifies the process of extracting frames from sprite sheets, organizing them into individual folders, and optionally creating GIFs/WebPs. It's designed to streamline your workflow by automating tedious tasks.

## Functionality
* Extracts and organizes frames from sprite sheets into folders named after respective sprites and animations.
* Provides an option to generate GIF or WebP for each animation. GIFs are prefixed with "_" for easy identification and placed at the top of the frame animation folder.
* Customization of animation frame rate.
* Customization of animation loop delay.

## Not yet implemented
* Selection of specific sprites for extraction (Currently processes entire folders).
* Option to override the global frame rate and loop delay settings for individual sprites and animations.
* Automated deletion of frames after GIF generation.
* Improved user interface for enhanced usability.
