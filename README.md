# TextureAtlas to GIF and Frames

This tool simplifies the process of extracting frames from sprite sheets, organizing them into individual folders, and optionally creating GIFs/WebPs. It's designed to streamline your workflow by automating tedious tasks.

## Current Spritesheet types supported
* Sparrow
* Starling

## Functionality
* Extracts and organizes frames from sprite sheets into folders named after respective sprites and animations.
* Provides an option to generate GIF or WebP for each animation. GIFs and WEBPs are prefixed with the spritesheet name for easy identification.
* Automatically crops GIFs as much as possible.
* Customization of animation frame rate.
* Customization of animation loop delay.
* Customization of alpha transparency threshold for GIFs.
* Override settings above and indices for individual sprites and animations.
* Option to delete frames after GIF/WebP generation.

## Not yet implemented
Feel free to help me implement anything on this list.
* Transition to the new QT UI inside the "new_ui_project" folder. (I'm malding over python classes, and I'm bit more busy irl lately)
* Implement the icon splitter tool into a sub menu when the new QT UI is fully implemented https://github.com/MeguminBOT/FNF-Icon-Splitter
* Selection of specific sprites for extraction (Currently processes entire folders).
* Automatically crop frames using the xml file data.
