# TextureAtlas to GIF and Frames

This tool simplifies the process of extracting frames from sprite sheets, organizing them into individual folders, and optionally creating GIFs. It's designed to streamline animation workflow by automating tedious tasks.

## Functionality
* Extracts and organizes frames from sprite sheets into folders named after respective sprites.
* Provides an option to generate GIFs at 24 FPS for each animation. GIFs are prefixed with "_" for easy identification and placed at the top of the frame animation folder.

## Not yet implemented
* Selection of specific sprites for extraction (Currently processes entire folders).
* Ability to designate a separate folder for saving GIFs.
* Customization of GIF frame rate.
* Automated deletion of frames after GIF generation.
* Improved user interface for enhanced usability.
