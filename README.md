# TextureAtlas-to-GIF-and-Frames
A tool that extracts all frames from a folder with spritesheets and sorts them into their own folders. Also includes a create gif option.

## Currently only takes folders as input and not individually selected sprites.
## Currently does NOT take frame offsets into consideration. (Working on it)!

Available as .exe here: https://github.com/MeguminBOT/TextureAtlas-to-GIF-and-Frames/releases/tag/v1.0
